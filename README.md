# sendtortm: Send webpage to Remember the Milk as a task

This lets you create Remember the Milk tasks from web pages. It creates
a toolbar button. When you want to convert a web page to a task:

1. click the toolbar button and a popup will pop up with the page title
   and url
2. click "Send" button on the popup
3. this will open another window on m.rememberthemilk.com where you
   can fill out the rest of the details for the task
4. click "Submit" and then close the window

In step 3, you might have to log into m.rememberthemilk.com depending
on whether you're logged into that site or not already.
